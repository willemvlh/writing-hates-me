   <title>Don't hire people just because you can</title>

      <p>Let's say a skilled person becomes available on the market and is interested in working for your company. What do you do? You hire him. Right?</p>
      <p>Yes, perhaps you do. But most work places are not comparable to football teams. You can't just buy a superstar and have him create value on the spot. When you hire somebody new,
      that person needs to be properly trained and mentored. They need to learn the company culture, who to ask for a day off, who to talk to in case of conflicts, what is and what is not expected of them, they need to become familiar with lots of processes that are probably not documented.
      They need to learn the hundreds of unwritten rules that exist in any company. </p>
      <p>Make sure you have the necessary resources to deal with onboarding a newcomer. When you just dump your new rockstar in a team and expect your existing employees to take care of them, you risk that new person getting lost because their colleagues don't have enough time, or your employees getting burnt out because they are expected to train a newcomer while still maintaining their regular output. The newcomer might feel disrepected because they are not getting a decent onboarding.
      This becomes even harder when people are not working from the same place, which is the case almost everywhere at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>You might even want to check if that person indeed possesses the skills needed for the job, and not just rely on reputation alone.</p>
      <p>Do not just hire somebody because they have a nice resume and expect somebody else to take care of integrating them in the company. It is not just disrespectful towards your existing employees, it is plain stupid because in the end their net value may well turn out to be negative.</p>
